# Train Sync
TrainSync is an IoT-powered railway automation system designed to improve passenger safety, operational efficiency, and real-time train visibility. Built by Team ECODUINO, the system integrates platform gate automation, railway crossing automation, GPS-based real-time tracking, ETA calculation, and QR-based boarding into a unified smart solution. Using ESP32 microcontrollers, ultrasonic sensors, GPS modules, ESP32-CAM, Flask, and Firebase, TrainSync delivers a modernized and safer railway experience by preventing early boarding, avoiding rail-cross accidents, enabling secure QR-verified compartment access, and providing live train locations to passengers.
